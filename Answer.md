1. the category_id field in the "Product" entity establishes a many-to-one relationship with the "Product_Category" entity, where each product belongs to one category, and each category can have multiple products associated with it.
. In the "Product" entity, the category_id field serves as a foreign key that references the id field in the "Product_Category" entity.
This means that each product in the "Product" entity is associated with a specific category defined in the "Product_Category" entity.
For example, if you have a product "Laptop" in the "Product" entity and it has a category_id of 1, it indicates that this laptop belongs to the category represented by the record with an id of 1 in the "Product_Category" entity.


2. I can enforce referential integrity by setting up a foreign key constraint between the "Product" table's category_id field and the primary key field (id) in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that every value in the category_id field of the "Product" table must exist in the id field of the "Product_Category" table.
